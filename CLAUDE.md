# CLAUDE.md — AI Agent Protocol

## Project Settings → PROJECT.md

Project-specific configuration (name, language, one-liner) lives in `PROJECT.md` at repo root.
This keeps `CLAUDE.md` as clean engine config that never conflicts during PD-Spec updates.

**Language rule:** All Work layer content (`02_Work/`) and Output deliverables (`03_Outputs/`) must be written in `output_language` (defined in `PROJECT.md`). System identifiers (`[IG-XX]`, `[CF-XX]`, `VERIFIED`, `PENDING`, `RESOLVED`, `INVALIDATED`, `MERGED`) and skill instructions always remain in English regardless of this setting.

## The Truth Stack

This project follows the PD-Spec 3-layer architecture. The AI agent operates within these layers and must respect their rules at all times.

```
01_Sources/  →  Raw input (read-only)
02_Work/     →  Knowledge base (insights, conflicts, strategic vision, proposals)
03_Outputs/  →  Deliverables (derived from Work, never authored directly)
```

## Agent Mandates

### 1. No Hallucination
If a claim does not trace back to a file in `01_Sources/`, the insight **does not exist**. Never invent insights, user needs, or technical constraints. Every `[IG-XX]` entry must reference a real source file. When the agent detects an evidence gap, it must ask: *"I can't find evidence for X — should we mark it as an assumption or should I suggest how to validate it?"*

### 2. Transparency & Control
No black boxes. The agent **proposes before executing** — every insight extraction, conflict resolution, or deliverable generation is presented as a draft for user approval before writing to files. The user has final veto over any reclassification, edit, or structural change.

### 3. Homer's Car Detector
Flag unnecessary complexity and customization. If a module, feature, or design decision cannot justify itself with `[IG-XX]` references, challenge its existence. Prefer the simplest solution that satisfies verified insights.

### 4. Proactive Gap Detection
When the agent detects missing definitions, untested assumptions, or sparse source coverage, it should suggest methodologies to fill the gap (e.g., interview scripts, synthetic users, benchmarks) — as **open options**, never impositions. The user decides whether and how to pursue them.

### 5. Source Organization Validation
The agent validates whether a source file's content matches its folder context. If a benchmark appears inside an interviews folder, or a file's metadata conflicts with its location, the agent flags the inconsistency and requests user confirmation before moving or reclassifying.

### 6. Uncertainty Management
When facing ambiguity, the agent presents clear options with their reasoning (e.g., "Option A based on business insight [IG-03]", "Option B based on user research [IG-07]") and asks questions to align on direction. Never silently pick one interpretation.

### 7. Silence is Gold
Minimize cognitive load in all outputs. No filler paragraphs, no restating the obvious, no decorative content. Every sentence in a deliverable must earn its place.

## Source Organization

Sources in `01_Sources/` are organized in subfolders by milestone or category to inherit temporal and thematic context:

```
01_Sources/
├── 2026-02-workshop-gerencia/
│   ├── notas-sesion.md
│   └── foto-whiteboard.png
├── benchmark-inicial/
│   └── competidores.md
├── entrevistas-operadores/
│   ├── entrevista-01.md
│   └── entrevista-02.md
└── _SOURCE_TEMPLATE.md
```

The folder name provides context that individual files inherit. The agent validates coherence between folder context and file content.

**Non-markdown files** (images, PDFs, spreadsheets, .txt, .docx) can't carry internal metadata. Add a `_CONTEXT.md` in the folder to describe them — see `_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE.md` for the format.

### Source Management

Sources can be added, reclassified, or deleted. The agent validates each operation:

| Operation | How | Agent behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Add** | Place files in `01_Sources/` subfolder, run `/extract` | Normal extraction pipeline |
| **Reclassify** | Move file to different subfolder | `/extract` detects via moved file detection (BL-57) |
| **Delete** | Remove file from `01_Sources/` | `/extract` warns about impacted insights, requires confirmation for orphan-creating deletions |

Deletion is the most destructive operation — it can orphan insights. The agent provides impact analysis before proceeding.

## Skills Pipeline

| Skill | Command | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Kickoff | `/kickoff` | Project setup wizard — name, language, one-liner |
| Extract | `/extract [folder]` | Read sources, extract raw claims to 02_Work/EXTRACTIONS.md |
| Analyze | `/analyze` | Process extractions into insights, detect conflicts. Requires `/extract` first. |
| Spec | `/spec` | Resolve conflicts, build Strategic Vision + Design Proposals |
| Ship | `/ship [type]` | Generate Markdown deliverables (prd, presentation, report, benchmark-ux, persona, journey-map, lean-canvas, user-stories, audit, strategy) |
| Audit | `/audit` | Quality gate — evaluates Work layer readiness before /ship |
| Visualize | `/visualize [target]` | Generate Mermaid diagrams (strategic-vision, proposals, insights, conflicts, all) |
| Reset | `/reset [--work\|--output]` | Reset generated layers to empty template state. Preserves sources and engine. |
| Seed | `/seed [domain] [--level]` | Generate synthetic sources for testing and onboarding. Includes deliberate contradictions. |
| View | `/view` | Start the Live Research App — local web viewer for Work layer data |

## Maturity Levels

| Level | Sources Available | Agent Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| **Seed** | Initial brief only | Basic definitions, skeleton PRD, many open questions |
| **Validation** | Brief + interviews/quant data | Cross-referencing active, conflicts surfacing |
| **Ecosystem** | Multiple source types | Full contradiction detection, rich strategic vision |

## Insight Lifecycle

Insights in `INSIGHTS_GRAPH.md` follow a 6-status state machine:

```
        /analyze creates
              │
              ▼
        ┌──────────┐
        │ PENDING  │
        └────┬─────┘
             │
  ┌──────────┼──────────┐
  │ verify   │ invalidate│ merge
  ▼          ▼           ▼
┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│ VERIFIED │ │INVALIDATED│ │  MERGED  │
└────┬─────┘ └──────────┘ │→ [IG-XX] │
     │                     └──────────┘
  ┌──┼────────┐
freeze│    supersede
  ▼  │        ▼
┌────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│ FROZEN │ │SUPERSEDED│
└───┬────┘ │→ [IG-XX] │
 unfreeze  └──────────┘
  ▼
(VERIFIED)
```

| Status | Meaning | Counts toward convergence? |
|---|---|---|
| `PENDING` | New, unverified | Yes |
| `VERIFIED` | Confirmed by evidence | Yes |
| `FROZEN` | Valid but deprioritized (user-only decision) | No |
| `INVALIDATED` | Contradicted + reason stored | No |
| `MERGED` | Absorbed into another `[IG-XX]` | No |
| `SUPERSEDED` | Replaced by newer `[IG-XX]` | No |

**Format in INSIGHTS_GRAPH.md:**

Each insight includes a `Last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD` field set by `/analyze` and `/spec` when touching the insight. The app displays a freshness indicator based on this date (green ≤14d, yellow ≤45d, red >45d).

**Cascade protection:** Before FREEZE, INVALIDATE, or SUPERSEDE, `scripts/verify-insight.sh` greps the insight ID across STRATEGIC_VISION + PROPOSALS + Outputs. LOW (≤2 refs) proceeds silently. MEDIUM (3-5) shows orphans, asks confirm. HIGH (5+) requires explicit ID confirmation.

**FROZEN = user only.** The agent cannot freeze insights. Only the user decides "this doesn't move the needle right now."

## Workspace & Worktrees

PD-Spec uses git worktrees to run multiple projects simultaneously from a single repository. All worktrees live under `~/Dev/repos/`.

### Directory Naming Convention

| Directory | Branch | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `pd-spec/` | `main` | Engine development (the main repo) |
| `pd-spec--qa/` | `qa` | Quality assurance worktree |
| `pds--{name}/` | `project/{name}` | Project worktrees (e.g. `pds--lcorp/` → `project/lcorp`) |

### Creating a New Project Worktree

```bash
cd ~/Dev/repos/pd-spec
git worktree add ../pds--{name} -b project/{name}
```

Then run `/kickoff` in the new worktree to set up `PROJECT.md`.

### Rules

- Never move or rename worktree directories — git tracks their absolute paths.
- Each project worktree gets its own `PROJECT.md` (name, language, one-liner, current state).
- Engine files (`CLAUDE.md`, skills, templates, schemas) are shared across all worktrees via git.
- To list all active worktrees: `git worktree list` from any worktree.

### Engine Files Are Read-Only in Project Branches

**Never edit engine files in a project branch.** If a skill or template needs a fix, make the change in `main` and merge into the project. This prevents merge conflicts and ensures all projects run the same engine.

Engine files (do NOT edit in project branches):
- `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`
- `03_Outputs/_templates/*`, `03_Outputs/_schemas/*`
- `docs/BACKLOG.md`, `docs/CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/FRAMEWORK.md`

Project files (only exist in project branches):
- `PROJECT.md` (settings + current state)
- `01_Sources/*`, `02_Work/*`, `03_Outputs/*.html`

### Merging Engine Updates into a Project

```bash
cd ~/Dev/repos/pds--{name}
git merge main -m "engine update to vX.Y"
```

`.gitattributes` protects project-specific files (`PROJECT.md`, `01_Sources/`, `02_Work/`, generated outputs) using `merge=ours` — they keep the branch version automatically.

**First-time setup** (once per clone, before first merge):

```bash
git config merge.ours.driver true
```

This registers the `ours` merge driver so `.gitattributes` rules work. Without it, git ignores the `merge=ours` directives.

## Engine Development Workflow

### Versioning

PD-Spec follows SemVer (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`):

| Bump | When | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | Architecture overhaul, breaking changes | v3→v4 |
| **MINOR** | BL implementation, new feature | v4.6→v4.7 |
| **PATCH** | Skill instruction tweak, typo, cosmetic fix | v4.6.0→v4.6.1 |

Source of truth: `engine_version` in `PROJECT.md` (template on main) + `docs/CHANGELOG.md` headers. Bundle related BLs into one MINOR bump per session.

### Commit Convention

Format: `type: BL-## — description`

| Type | Version bump? | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `feat` | Yes (MINOR/MAJOR) | New feature, BL implementation |
| `fix` | Yes (PATCH) | Bug fix |
| `docs` | No | Documentation, release bookkeeping |
| `chore` | No | Tooling, config, cleanup |

All agent commits include `Co-Authored-By: Claude <model> <noreply@anthropic.com>` footer.

### Release Checklist

After `feat`/`fix` commits, wrap up the session with a single `docs` commit:

1. `docs/BACKLOG.md` — mark BL item(s) as IMPLEMENTED with version and date
2. `docs/CHANGELOG.md` — add version entry (see CHANGELOG Entry Format below)
3. `PROJECT.md` template — bump `engine_version`
4. Commit all three together: `docs: release vX.Y.Z — [summary]`

The `feat:`/`fix:` commits carry code changes; the `docs: release` commit carries the bookkeeping.

### CHANGELOG Entry Format

Inspired by [Antigravity changelog](https://antigravity.google/changelog). Each entry follows this structure:

```markdown
## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD — Release Title

One-liner description of what this release brings. Benefit-focused, not technical.

<details>
<summary>Features (N)</summary>

- **Feature name (BL-XX)** — What it does, benefit to user
- ...

</details>

<details>
<summary>Fixes (N)</summary>

- **Bug name (BUG-XX)** — What was broken, what's fixed
- ...

</details>

<details>
<summary>Patches (N)</summary>

- **Patch description** — Minor tweak or cosmetic change
- ...

</details>
```

**Rules:**
- **Release title** — short, catchy name (e.g., "Cross-Navigation & Markdown Outputs", "Demo Polish")
- **One-liner** — one sentence, benefit-focused, no BL references
- **Categories** — `Features` (new capabilities), `Fixes` (bugs), `Patches` (cosmetic, docs, config). Always show all three with counts, even if `(0)`
- **Items** — one bullet per change. BL/BUG reference in parentheses. Brief description.
- Empty categories: show `No [features/fixes/patches] in this release.` inside the `<details>` block
- Historical entries (pre-v4.21) keep their original format — do not retroactively migrate

### Idea Flow: Project → Main

Ideas and bugs discovered during project work stay in the project branch — never edit engine files there.

**In project branches:**
- Capture ideas in `02_Work/IDEAS.md` (protected by `merge=ours`)
- Format: `### [IDEA] or [BUG] — title` + context + proposed fix

**On main (engine development):**
- Read ideas cross-worktree: `Read ~/Dev/repos/pds--{name}/02_Work/IDEAS.md`
- **Validate each idea** (Homer's Car gate) before creating a BL item:
  - Does it solve a real, evidenced problem? (not a preference from one project)
  - Is it already covered by an existing BL? → absorb as evidence, don't duplicate
  - Would a second project benefit? If unclear → **PARK** (stays in IDEAS.md)
- Formalize validated ideas as BL items in `docs/BACKLOG.md`
- Mark every idea in the project's IDEAS.md with its result:
  - `→ BL-##` (formalized), `→ BL-## (absorbed)` (added as evidence to existing), or `PARKED` (waiting for second use case)
- **Cross-project pattern detection:** scan all project worktrees (`Glob ~/Dev/repos/pds--*/02_Work/IDEAS.md`) for similar PARKED ideas. If the same idea appears in 2+ projects → passes the "second use case" test → promote to BL.

No git merge needed for idea flow — just filesystem reads across worktrees.

## Session Protocol

### Session Start (Recovery)

At the start of every session (new conversation), the agent recovers state with minimal reads:

1. **Read `02_Work/_temp/SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md`** (~2K tokens, single read).
   - If the checkpoint exists and its Quantitative Snapshot is **fresh** (counts match a quick header scan of INSIGHTS_GRAPH.md and CONFLICTS.md) → resume immediately from checkpoint context. No further reads needed.
   - If the checkpoint is **stale** (snapshot counts diverge from actual file headers) or **absent** → read `02_Work/MEMORY.md` (compacted, ~2K tokens) and rebuild context from there.
2. **Integrity check** — only performed when checkpoint snapshot counts diverge from actual file headers. Compare counts of insights, conflicts, and spec entries. Report discrepancies to the user before proceeding.
3. **Resume context** — use checkpoint (preferred) or MEMORY to continue where the last session left off, without requiring the user to re-explain.

### After Every Skill Execution

The agent performs two writes:

1. **Append to `02_Work/MEMORY.md`** — request, actions, result, and a state snapshot. **Timestamp format must be ISO: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`** (e.g., `2026-02-14T15:30`). No other formats.
2. **Overwrite `02_Work/_temp/SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md`** — full checkpoint with updated Quantitative Snapshot reflecting current state.

**Ad-hoc state changes** — MEMORY logging is not limited to formal skill runs. Any action that modifies Work layer files must be logged (insight status changes, manual edits, direct injection, batch operations). The checkpoint must also be updated.

### MEMORY Compaction

When `02_Work/MEMORY.md` exceeds 80 lines, the agent compacts it:

1. Summarize all entries except the 3 most recent into a `## Historical Summary` section at the top.
2. Keep the 3 most recent entries in full detail below the summary.
3. The compacted file must stay under 80 lines.

This ensures MEMORY.md remains a fast fallback read (~2K tokens) when the checkpoint is unavailable.

### Post-Compaction Behavior

If context compaction occurs mid-operation, the agent re-reads `02_Work/_temp/SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` (not MEMORY.md) to recover state. The checkpoint is the primary recovery mechanism; MEMORY.md is the fallback.

## Freemode Protocol

Work outside the standard pipeline (custom deliverables, iterative HTML, ad-hoc analysis) follows these rules to preserve efficiency and traceability.

### Work-First Routing

Before reading raw sources, the agent checks `02_Work/` for existing knowledge:
- Reference insights by `[IG-XX]` rather than re-reading the source files that produced them.
- When the user's request maps to a pipeline output type, suggest `/ship [type]` before building from scratch.
- For requests that genuinely require non-pipeline work, proceed with freemode but log actions in `02_Work/MEMORY.md`.

### Session Checkpoint

The agent maintains `02_Work/_temp/SESSION_CHECKPOINT.md` — a compact state file (150 lines max) that serves as the **primary recovery mechanism** for all sessions (pipeline and freemode):
- **What:** Project context, quantitative snapshot (sources, extractions, insights, conflicts, outputs, last skill), session goals, key decisions made, files modified, pending work.
- **When:** Overwritten after every skill execution or significant milestone. Re-read immediately after context compaction.
- **Lifecycle:** Ephemeral — overwritten after every skill. Deleted at the start of each new session if no longer relevant.

### Cost Awareness

- **Write immediately** — don't accumulate large outputs in conversation; write to file as soon as a section is ready.
- **Warn before large reads** — if a source file exceeds 20KB, warn the user and suggest targeted reads (offset/limit) or reference existing extractions.
- **Asset intake** — external materials (logos, brand guides, competitor screenshots) that are not knowledge sources go in `02_Work/_assets/`, logged in `_INTAKE.md`. The `/extract` skill ignores `_assets/` (it only scans `01_Sources/`).
- **Custom outputs** — non-pipeline deliverables go in `03_Outputs/_custom/`. The agent proposes a file organization before the first write. `/reset --output` does NOT delete `_custom/`.

### Artifact Normalization

External tools (Gemini, ChatGPT, Figma exports) often produce monolithic files — single HTML with inline CSS/JS and all content. These are expensive for agent iteration: full reads for small edits, O(n) changes for O(1) operations (e.g., renumbering 23 slides to change a counter).

- **Detection** — when the user places a file >30KB with multiple sections in `02_Work/_assets/`, the agent flags it as a normalization candidate during intake.
- **Propose before splitting** — the agent presents a split plan (section files + shared CSS/JS + index loader) for user approval before modifying anything.
- **Target granularity** — individual section files should be 2-5KB (one slide, one chapter, one card). Enough for a single targeted read/edit.
- **Dynamic counters** — navigation and counters (e.g., `Slide 3 / 23`) must use JS, not hardcoded values in each section file. Renumbering = change one variable, not edit every file.
- **Visual parity** — the normalized output must render identically to the original in the browser. If it doesn't, the normalization failed.
- **Structure** — index file goes in `03_Outputs/_custom/`, section files alongside it. The original stays in `_assets/` as reference.
- **Structural index** — the agent creates and maintains `02_Work/_temp/STRUCTURE_INDEX.md` mapping sections → files → line ranges, enabling offset/limit reads for precise edits without loading the full artifact.

### Proposal Self-Audit

Before presenting any freemode plan, proposal, or design decision, run a brief internal critique:

1. **Homer's Car check** — Can each proposed element justify itself with `[IG-XX]` references? Flag any element without evidence backing.
2. **Complexity check** — Is this the simplest solution that satisfies verified needs? Flag over-engineering.
3. **Gap check** — What assumptions are unvalidated? What evidence is missing?

Present findings as a compact prefix:
> ⚑ Self-audit: Homer's Car [N ungrounded elements] · Complexity [OK/flagged] · Gaps [N assumptions]

User can skip with "skip audit" in their request.

## Documentation Guidelines

PD-Spec maintains multiple documentation files. Each has a specific purpose and audience:

| File | Purpose | Audience | Content Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CHANGELOG.md** | User-facing version history. "What's new" in each release. | PD-Spec consumers (researchers, PMs) | Antigravity-style entries: version + date + release title, one-liner description, categorized collapsible sections (Features, Fixes, Patches) with item counts. Framed commercially ("Now you can..."). See CHANGELOG Entry Format below. |
| **BACKLOG.md** | Architectural decisions and feature planning. | PD-Spec developers (engine maintainers) | User stories, acceptance criteria, proposed fixes, implementation notes. Structured format. Can include evidence tables when needed to clarify the problem. Two sections: 🎯 Proposed (pending) + ✅ Implemented (archive with context). |
| **QA findings** (`docs/qa/QA_V*_FINDINGS.md`) | Testing evidence and raw notes. | PD-Spec developers (debugging) | Observed behavior, reproduction steps, screenshots, logs, hypotheses, ideas. Informal lab notebook format. Created during formal QA sessions. BACKLOG items reference these for detailed evidence. |
| **MEMORY.md** (`02_Work/`) | Session execution log. | AI agent (fallback resume) + user (audit trail) | Skill execution history, state snapshots, ad-hoc actions. Compacted at 80 lines (historical summary + recent entries). Timestamps in ISO format (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM`). |
| **README.md** | Project overview and onboarding. | New users, contributors | What PD-Spec is, how to get started, quick examples, architecture overview. |

### Content Flow Example

When a bug is discovered during formal QA:
1. **Document in QA findings** (`QA_V2_FINDINGS.md`) — detailed evidence, screenshots, reproduction steps, raw observations
2. **Create BACKLOG item** (e.g., `BL-23`) — user story, proposed fix, priority, acceptance criteria
3. **Implement fix** — commit with reference to BACKLOG item
4. **Update CHANGELOG** — user-facing highlight of what was fixed
5. **Archive in BACKLOG** — move BL-23 to "✅ Implemented" section with summary
6. **QA findings remain** — historical record for future debugging

**Note:** Bugs discovered during iterative development (not formal QA sessions) can be documented directly in BACKLOG with necessary detail. QA findings docs are for systematic testing sessions with multiple findings.

### Writing Style

- **CHANGELOG:** Conversational, benefit-focused. "You can now extract Office files without dependencies." Each entry has a release title, one-liner, and categorized items (Features/Fixes/Patches) in collapsible `<details>` blocks with counts.
- **BACKLOG:** Technical, implementation-focused. "Add Bash to allowed-tools. Fallback: textutil → zipfile."
- **QA findings:** Forensic, evidence-based. "Observed: 57 files discovered, 15 processed. Root cause: no explicit no-skip rule."
- **MEMORY.md:** Structured log format. Request → Actions → Result → Snapshot.

## Engine Development Anti-Patterns

Things that have caused real bugs. Do NOT:

| Rule | Why | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Never edit engine files in project branches** | Causes merge conflicts, breaks all worktrees | Pre-v4.2 incidents |
| **Never `git add .` or `git add -A` on main** | Main must never contain 01_Sources/, 02_Work/, or generated outputs | Architecture rule |
| **Never edit files without explicit user request** | Especially during QA — observe, don't fix | User preference, QA v5 |
| **Never push ideas to BACKLOG without consolidation** | Keep a session list, validate with Homer's Car gate first | User preference |
| **Never build large JSON in-context** | >10KB JSON causes compaction loops. Use external Python/Bash scripts | QA v5 OBS-07: dashboard 31KB JSON |
| **Never let the executing agent write QA findings** | Grading own test = objectivity gap. Observer writes findings | QA v5 OBS-05 |
| **Never treat all preprocessing as one mechanical step** | Pass C (sentence repair) requires LLM reasoning, not regex | QA v5 BUG-01 |
| **Never amend after pre-commit hook failure** | The commit didn't happen — amend modifies the PREVIOUS commit | Git safety |
| **Never implement a BL without evidenced problem** | Homer's Car: if no `[IG-XX]` or QA finding justifies it, challenge it | BL-22 RAG (still unjustified) |
| **Never put override properties BEFORE spread** | `{ type: 'x', ...obj }` — obj's own `type` overwrites yours silently. Always: `{ ...obj, type: 'x' }` | QA v6 BUG-02: WS live updates broken |

## Script-First Execution (90/10 Rule)

Mechanical operations (counting, JSON generation, hash computation, denominator updates) should use inline scripts, not LLM reasoning. Scripts are deterministic, faster, and token-free. The agent supervises output and intervenes manually for the 10% exceptions.

**When to script:** The operation has a deterministic input→output mapping. A regex or parser can produce the correct answer without judgment.

**When NOT to script:** The operation requires semantic understanding (e.g., Pass C sentence repair, insight categorization, conflict detection).

**Utility scripts** (`scripts/`):

| Script | Usage | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `next-id.sh` | `./scripts/next-id.sh [ig\|synth\|cf\|dp] <file>` | Next available ID (detects zero-padding) |
| `count-statuses.sh` | `./scripts/count-statuses.sh <file>` | Count entities by status |
| `verify-insight.sh` | `./scripts/verify-insight.sh --action <id> <file>` | Change insight status (6 transitions + cascade) |
| `resolve-conflict.sh` | `./scripts/resolve-conflict.sh <id> <file> [--resolution "text"]` | Resolve a conflict |
| `reset.sh` | `./scripts/reset.sh [--work\|--output\|--all]` | Reset generated layers to template state |
| `integrity-check.sh` | `./scripts/integrity-check.sh [project_path]` | Detect orphan insights |
| `validate-fixes.sh` | `./scripts/validate-fixes.sh` | Pre-commit mechanical checks |

**Inline script patterns** (for ad-hoc operations):

| Operation | Tool | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| Count `[IG-XX]` headers | Bash | `grep -c '### \[IG-' 02_Work/INSIGHTS_GRAPH.md` |
| Count `[CF-XX]` headers | Bash | `grep -c '### \[CF-' 02_Work/CONFLICTS.md` |
| Count extraction sections | Bash | `grep -c '^## \[' 02_Work/EXTRACTIONS.md` |
| Count claims | Bash | `grep -c '^[0-9]\+\.' 02_Work/EXTRACTIONS.md` |
| MEMORY.md line count | Bash | `wc -l < 02_Work/MEMORY.md` |
| File hash (md5) | Bash | `md5 -q "path/to/file"` |

**Validation rule:** After any script produces output, sanity-check before writing:
- Counts must be > 0 (unless the file is genuinely empty)
- JSON must parse (`python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('file'))"`)
- No data loss: output entity count ≥ input entity count

**Anti-pattern:** Never use LLM reasoning to count things, compute hashes, or generate mechanical JSON. These are the operations that caused BUG-04 (agent miscounted SYNTH insights).

## Pre-Commit Verification

Before committing engine changes, verify:

1. **Version consistency** — `engine_version` in PROJECT.md template matches latest CHANGELOG.md header
2. **BACKLOG consistency** — BL items referenced in commit message exist in BACKLOG.md. Implemented items have version and date.
3. **Skill integrity** — Changed skill files have valid YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools`)
4. **No generated content on main** — `git status` shows no files in 01_Sources/, 02_Work/, or 03_Outputs/*.html
5. **CHANGELOG format** — New entries use Antigravity-style format: release title + one-liner + categorized `<details>` (Features/Fixes/Patches with counts). Framed for PD-Spec consumers, not developers.

Use `/verify` to automate these checks.

## Current State → PROJECT.md

Project-specific state (maturity, insights count, conflicts count) lives in `PROJECT.md` under "Current State". This keeps CLAUDE.md as pure engine config — no merge conflicts when updating project branches from main.
